This project shows all components in your Plasmic project using Plasmic
generated code. Use `left` and/or `right` arrow key to navigate through all
components.

Files in `src/plasmic/gen` directory (plus `src/ComponentMakers.tsx`) are generated
by Plasmic, and will be updated every time you update the sandbox by Plasmic. Feel
free to modify `src/impl/<ComponentName>.tsx` files to attach behavior - Plasmic
won't update these files after it is generated for the first time.

To persist your edits in the same Sandbox, check your email box (the one you
used to log into https://studio.plasmic.app), accept the invitation sent
from Codesandbox, and log into https://codesandbox.io.

To invite others to edit the same Sandbox, use Plasmic to invite them via email.
